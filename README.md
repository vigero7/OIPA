# 🔍 OIPA - Open Source Image Privacy Analyzer

OIPA is a Python-based cybersecurity and OSINT tool that analyzes images for privacy risks. It detects embedded metadata (EXIF), faces, and textual entities like names, emails, and dates. Based on the extracted information, it generates a detailed privacy risk report.

> 🎯 Built to demonstrate image-level privacy assessment using AI and open-source intelligence (OSINT) principles.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📷 **Image Metadata Extraction** (EXIF)
- 🧠 **Face Detection** using deep learning
- 📝 **Textual Entity Extraction** (names, emails, dates, locations)
- 🔐 **Privacy Risk Assessment** with scoring logic
- 📄 **JSON Report Generation**


---

## 🚀 Demo

```bash
# Analyze a local image
python main.py --image data/sample_images/1.jpg

# Or analyze from an online URL
python main.py --url https://example.com/photo.jpg
````

You’ll get output like:

```
🔍 Analyzing image: ...
[✓] Metadata extracted
[✓] 1 face(s) detected
[✓] Entities extracted
[✓] Privacy Risk: MEDIUM (Score: 45)
✅ Report saved to: report.json
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Collect**: Image is collected from local path or URL.
2. **Analyze**:

   * Extracts EXIF data (e.g. GPS, camera info)
   * Detects faces using `face_recognition`
   * Extracts named entities using `spaCy`
3. **(Optional)** Reverse Image Search (Tineye/Bing/etc.)
4. **Assess**: Evaluates privacy risk based on detected data.
5. **Report**: Saves result in a JSON file.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* `Python 3.8+`
* `face-recognition`
* `spaCy`
* `Pillow`
* `piexif`
* `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`
* `Streamlit` *(optional frontend, WIP)*
